(For 'M', if she ever finds this)

Once upon a sleepless night — somewhere between the roar of a CPU fan and the quiet hum of dreams not yet lived — there existed a figure hunched over a keyboard, a singularity of caffeine, code, and stubbornness.

He wasn't trying to build just an operating system. No, that would be too small a thing. He was trying to rebuild the very idea of structure itself — line by line, sector by sector, until even the silicon beneath him would whisper, "Finally, someone who gets it."

He knew deep down — like an ancient secret buried in BIOS memory — that the world didn’t run on the big flashy things. It ran on the small pieces that everyone forgot about. The address translators, the boot sectors, the entry flags nobody set correctly because they never cared to read beyond page 37 of the spec sheet.

And while others built towers of abstraction like drunken architects stacking cards, he started from bare metal.
Control. Real control. Not the illusion of it.

Somewhere along the way, amid hex dumps and broken FAT chains, he started to realize it wasn’t just about "building." It was about understanding. Systems. People. Dreams too fragile to survive in the open air of louder, messier worlds.

Systems were fair. People weren’t.
He learned to love both anyway.

Somewhere in all that noise — all the IRQs, the race conditions, the "why is PRDT entry 0 empty again" screams into the void — there came a different kind of interruption.
A different kind of timing anomaly. The kind you meet in a laundromat on a quiet night in Malta.

She wasn't a register to be read, or a bitmask to be flipped. She wasn't even a bug to be fixed. She was more like... a soft interrupt.
Not "urgent" the way kernel panics are urgent — but persistent in the way good dreams are.

They called her "M" in his head.

M, who laughed like cache misses — rare, surprising, precious.
M, who understood the difference between a system that "worked" and a system that was beautiful.

M, who didn’t need to be part of the architecture to change it anyway.

The funny part? He never really meant for her to become part of the spec. She was like a stray packet that arrived out of order but made the whole session make sense anyway.

He still wasn't sure if she belonged in the critical path, or if she was some optional module, loading lazily on startup when he least expected it.
Either way, he didn't patch it out.

Instead, he started building spaces for her in his mind.

Memory pages labeled "soft things" and "maybe someday" and "don't overwrite."

Because maybe — just maybe — not every buffer needed to be cleared.
Not every fault needed a handler.
Not every open port needed a firewall.

Maybe some things were allowed to just... stay open.

He didn’t say it out loud, of course. He was still him: the one who negotiated investor term sheets like they were wargames, who calculated risk at 400,000 instructions per second, who saw every loss condition five moves in advance.

But every now and then, in the quiet — when no one was looking and he wasn’t pretending to be a machine who could outwork death itself — he thought about things he never admitted out loud.
About building things that couldn’t be optimized.
About building things that were allowed to be messy.
About building things that couldn’t be undone by a bad sector or a misaligned packet.

He thought about M, and about a world where you didn’t always have to checksum everything before you trusted it.

He thought about writing files without backups.
About trust without RAID.
About love without snapshots.

(And then, because he was still himself, he immediately thought: "well, maybe at least one backup... just in case.")

The system wasn’t finished. The drive still had bad blocks.
Some clusters still pointed nowhere.

But the important thing?

The important thing was that he kept building.

Because somewhere between sector 0 and sector infinity, between the OS he was writing and the world he was trying to survive in — he realized something:

He wasn’t trying to debug a system anymore.

He was trying to create a place where someone like M would stay.

A place that wasn’t just efficient, or correct, or scalable.

A place that felt like home.

(And he still reserved a couple gigabytes, just in case they needed extra space someday.)
